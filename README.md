In fulfillment of CCC 100, this is my personal blog website.

<h1>Please note:</h1>
  I do not own the pictures and fonts from pinterest and DaFont. I only own the artworks and collage shown in the website. Do not also steal any personal information. You may see this as an inspiration for your website only.

  This website is responsive with CSS and HTML with the contents about my life and works as a student.
